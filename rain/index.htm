<p>Everyone's heard of snow days, but did anyone else ever have rain days?</p>
<p>I swear, one day, it was pouring so hard it sounded like someone was jumping on the roof of the house. Soooo my mom called school and made them cancel just so I wouldn't have to walk over XP like come on mom, a little water never hurt anyone. (Except maybe for deep-sea cave divers XD  .................. Sorry.)</p>
<p>At least because of that my friend could come over... WITHOUT AN UMBRELLA. Whyyy X) She was totally soaked, we had to put three of my mom's hairdryers on full blast for like 30 minutes. (At least we got to use the dryer to make melty cheese crackers)</p>
<p>Anyways, on days where it rains, nothing was better than playing Cat Petters. Specifically, the minigames you can play with your cats. They were all ridiculous, and every one of them had these super sillyriffic names. Like, JONGLER or something? XD What does that meaaaaan...</p>
<p>I remember being really into one of the games when I was little, I can't remember the name because it was complete nonsense sorry XP but it was the one that was like an endless cave if that makes sense. I even made a guide to the rarities of the different cats you could get to raise your score. I still have the text file, although it's just named "b.txt". (Really helpful, me XP )</p>
<pre>chances<br>80%---normal<br>15%---blue ora<br>4%---rock & roll<br>0%---ANGLE WING!!!!<br>00000%-----------SUPER HOLY ANGlE WING!!!!</pre>
<p>I... sort of feel like there were more, though. Like, one time, I remember getting a cat and it actually LOWERED how many points I had. And then of course I died immediately, so I couldn't get a picture or anything. And of course no one else has ever seemed to see this...</p>
<p>Actually, I get the feeling someone else I know has seen it, but, I just know that even if I asked them, I probably wouldn't get a straight answer XP ugh...</p>
<p>Superfun Fact: On a related note, these same games even make a cameo in Cat Petters The RPG. (Which,like everything good, is kind of a ripoff of Dragon Blazers if I'm being honest... XD Okey-dokey, let my bias show for a second there XP You guys should really play it though...)</p>
<p>AS USUAL, if anyone thinks they can find any proof, <a href="../rarecats/index.htm">try it yourself</a> and let me know!</p>
<p>ps - about my friend. She came over because I said I was going to play Cat Petters, but she thought that meant that I was just going to pet HER... umm, what kind of game would that even be... XD So I just made a cat named after her in the game and made it play metal music on the music box X) (I'll try not to corrupt that one XP) (I still had to pet her a little or she wouldn't go home XP)</p>
